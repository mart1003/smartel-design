            <p>This project is not official an official rebrand, nor is it affiliated with Bluebird Coffee.</p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this product was to improve upon the logo and brand of an existing local business. I wanted to create a simple, recognizable logo that contained subtle imagery for people to discover for themselves.</p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>This multi week process involved researching the business, its competitors, target audience, producing and presenting a sales pitch, etc. Through many sketches, iterations, and meetings with classmates and the art director,
            the direction for the logo was solidified, and digital production began. Afterwards, a visual itentity for the brand was created, with a fresh and modern identity compared to the current branding.</p>
            <p>After the visual identity was complete, I put together a printed brand guideline to outline how the logo should be used, and how the brand should be presented in great detail.</p>
            <h2>Result</h2>
